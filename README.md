This is a fork of a repo made jjb3rd. The main things I'm changing are:

1. Changing the HTTP client library to Flurl: http://tmenier.github.io/Flurl/
1. Adding some more functionality to suit my own needs (not sure exactly what yet - read the commits - but an example would be to receive more data from the API)
